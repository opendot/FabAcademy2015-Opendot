                            <p>I had never developed anything before Fab Academy and I had never even built a website. I built my site using a template bootstrap and then I developed it in html, with the use of CSS, through brackets. <br>The last step of the first week was to define a concept of the final project. I thought of two projects: <br> &#0149; The first project, that i decide to develop during Fab Academy, aims to create a system that is able to track people movement in indoor space. Track means to measure movement point to point, stay time and people concentrations in critical point of rooms <img src="img/pj1a.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br> &#0149; Second project regards problems and defects in human posture and aims to create a wearable system that shows postural errors while walking, while standing and especially while sitting.</p> <img src="img/pj2a.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p> During <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html">second week </a>, the task was to start from the sketch drawn to design the draft final project and achieve its design in 3d. Again, given my backgroud, I had to use sofware and concepts that I had never used before. The goal was to try, make mistakes and learn from more software as possible, both in 2D and in 3D. First I had to choose what to draw, as the project is not yet defined in detail. I decided to set up the project on a wearable device, so that people to track have with them a bracelet that I hope in the end could have a nice design. I've started to draw in 2D using Inksacape that at first glance I thought it was simple and effective for a beginner like me.</p>

                            <br> <p>Beyond the difficulty in obtaining a good quality file svg of FabLab logo, I managed to get an acceptable design in 2D. The next step, and the most complex, was to model the svg files in 3D. I mainly used blender and to do that I had to follow of course many video tutorials and guides found on line. With blender I extruded the files in 2D and especially I rotated the parts in the direction I wanted. Then I defined color of materials and tried to change the individual faces of the object created.</p>

                            <br> <p>In the last line I have also tried to realize the rendering of the image, but without animation and always using blender</p>

                            <br> <p>During the design phase, I also used FreeCAD. But failing to install the software on the Mac I had to use it on another computer windows. FreeCAD seemed very intuitive compared to Blender but once you pass the initial impact it seemed more complete</p>

                            <h2>Computer-controlled Cutting</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>The week dedicated to learning <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/index.html">cuttings tools</a> was mainly focused on laser cutting and vinyl cutting. The objective was to provide an exercise by designing and cutting an object whose parts were modular and then assembled to achieve a structure in 3D. So designing in 2D to cut an object in 3D!</p>
                            <img src="img/lesson3.1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I started the week looking at some completed projects with cutting machines, mainly with laser cutting, to get inspired about my exercise. I focused my research on           <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> and <a href="http://www.instructables.com">Instructables</a> and then some images on the web. At the end I decided to make a stand for my iPad.</p>
                             <img src="img/lesson3.2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>As for the previous week, to design in 2D I used Inkscape, following some tutorials to understand how to best set the edges and points to be embedded in a piece and another.</p>
                             <img src="img/lesson3.3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                             <img src="img/lesson3.4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>During the design had to also consider the instructions of the lab regarding the thickness of the sheets (3mm) of wood to be used and the kerf (0,12mm) of the laser cutting machine. All this has been necessary to design in a correct way the joints between the various parts.</p>
                            <img src="img/lesson3.5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                             <p>Before proceeding to define the edges and save the file in pdf format and then proceed to cut, I entered the FabLab logo and text to engrave on the surface where it will be based the iPad </p> 
                          <img src="img/lesson3.8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/lesson3.6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                             <img src="img/lesson3.7.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                     <p>After designing the stand, I continued with the cut. I saved the file in inkscape in dxf format and then i open it on Rhino (4 format) to start cutting. I had some problem with the speed of cutting, maybe because the wood sheet was deformed. So i had external lines cutted in some area and and not in other areas. To resove this problem i fixed a lower speed of cutting. An other problem was about the angle of a piece that overlaps the hole of another piece: a design problem. I learned that inkscape is a good software for design this kind of project but especially in case of design some angular holes it's better to use Rhino!</p>  
                              <img src="img/lesson3.9.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Once i resolved design problems i cutted again my project and after i assembled it. This is the result: </p>

                            <p>The exercise of this <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html">week</a> was to design and then print a small object in 3D and then scan and eventually print a real object. The first part of the exercise was achieved through Inkscape to draw the model in 2D. I wanted to create an object consisting of a letter and a circle with the initial of my surname. Is an object that maybe in the future I might change it into a keychain, maybe when I become famous!</p>
                                                        <img src="img/lesson5.1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <img src="img/lesson5.2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br> <p>After finishing the design in 2D on Inkscape I tried to make the model in 3D with SketchUp. Personally i think that this software is certainly easier to use but for a complex and professional design I think it is needed best software. So I saved my file in .dxf on Inkscape and then work it on SketchUp. This is the result of design, printing instead will be made in the lab during the next week.</p>

                            <p>The exercise of this <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html">week</a> was to redraw the echo hello-world board and add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor) check the design rules, and make it. As for the previous weeks I had to start my preparation beginning from 0. So I bought a book of electronics for beginners to become familiar with the basic principles of this discipline. Once learned the basics to perform the exercise I have been closely following the <a href="http://www.fabacademy.org/archives/2015/doc/electronics_design_eagle.html">tutorial</a> published in Fab Academy. The first step was to download eagle and begin to understand its characteristics. Later I added the libraries of components required.</p>  <img src="img/lesson6.1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson6.2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson6.3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>This is the final result with all component, led, button and links in the schematic view. <p/> <img src="img/lesson6.4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p> Once finished the schematic i worked on the board to draw trace to link all the components. I tried to choose the function "autorouter" but i prefered to draw manually all the trace and understand the feature of eagle in this phase.<p/> <img src="img/lesson6.5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <p>Once I link all the traces I remove all layers except the top and i saved the file in .png and modified it in gimp with the parameters suggested in the previous tutorial. </p> <img src="img/lesson6.6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson6.8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <p>The last step was to enter a text and fill with white traces black. So the last image even if it expresses almost nothing, is the image to be used to realize materially the board. As for 3D printing of last week i will make the board next week in Open Dot</p>  <img src="img/lesson6.7.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
