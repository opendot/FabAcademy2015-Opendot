                            <hr class="star-primary">
                           <p> <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/index.html"> The first lesson </a> of Fab Acadamy 2015 was a presentation of course, the concept of Fab Lab and digital fabrication a first introduction of tools to build the web site that will contain my background, all my experience in Fab Academy and especially my final project.  </p>
                            <img src="img/lesson1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I had never developed anything before Fab Academy and I had never even built a website. I built my site using a template bootstrap and then I developed it in html, with the use of CSS, through brackets. To better understand html and CSS I immediately looked for a nice template to open with brackets to modify it and check their effects. I quickly chose this <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/">template</a> and from there I started to change the parts that interested me in terms of graphics and building the various pages to better document my Fab Academy<br> The other topic of the week but fundamental for the entire route of the Fab Academy has been the creation and management of the repository project. At OpenDot we used <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> as a matter of easy and immediacy of use. We decided to manage all the commands from bash, then we synchronized the repository created by our tutor, entered the credentials from the terminal and did pull of ours Fab Academy folders. <img src="img/lesson1.2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson1.3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br> The commands you use most often are:
                                <li align="justify">git pull - in order to get an updated version of everything</li>
                <li align="justify">git add (filename) - for selecting a specific file or</li>
                <li align="justify">git add -A - in order to put all files or</li>
                <li align="justify">git add -u - for selecting already tracked files that are modified</li>
                <li align="justify">git commit -m "message" - for saving a commit in the local repository</li>
                <li align="justify">git pull - in order to be sure that you have everything updated</li>
                <li align="justify">git push - in order to send everything you commited to github</li>
                </p> <br><p>The last step of the first week was to define a concept of the final project.

                            <h2>Computer-aided design</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>During <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html">second week </a>, the task was to start from the sketch drawn to design the draft final project and achieve its design in 3d. Again, given my backgroud, I had to use sofware and concepts that I had never used before. The goal was to try, make mistakes and learn from more software as possible, both in 2D and in 3D. First I had to choose what to draw, as the project is not yet defined in detail. I decided to set up the project on a wearable device, so that people to track have with them a bracelet that I hope in the end could have a nice design. I've started to draw in 2D using Inksacape that at first glance I thought it was simple and effective for a beginner like me.</p>

                            <img src="img/lesson2.1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br> <p>Beyond the difficulty in obtaining a good quality file svg of FabLab logo, I managed to get an acceptable design in 2D. The next step, and the most complex, was to model the svg files in 3D. I mainly used blender and to do that I had to follow of course many video tutorials and guides found on line. With blender I extruded the files in 2D and especially I rotated the parts in the direction I wanted. Then I defined color of materials and tried to change the individual faces of the object created.</p>
                            <img src="img/lesson2.4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                             <img src="img/lesson2.5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/lesson2.6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br> <p>In the last line I have also tried to realize the rendering of the image, but without animation and always using blender</p>
                             <img src="img/lesson2.3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br> <p>During the design phase, I also used FreeCAD. But failing to install the software on the Mac I had to use it on another computer windows. FreeCAD seemed very intuitive compared to Blender but once you pass the initial impact it seemed more complete. <br><br>The last program I tried was Rhino. I re-extruded and fixed the svg file and then placed and rotated the logo. I fixed finally also the size of the bracelet and whole viewed as a solid object.<img src="img/lesson2.8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson2.9.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson2.10.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></p> <br> <p>The lesson learned is that blender is a very interesting software, as completely open, developed in python and definitely good for the non-geometric figures. Rhino, however, after an initial block in understanding all commands it seemed the best for geometrical figures to be realized in a simple and very precise way and also to fix non-geometric figures such as drawn in blender and then optimized in Rhino</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p> <p>The week dedicated to learning <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/index.html">cuttings tools</a> was mainly focused on laser cutting and vinyl cutting. The objective was to provide an exercise by designing and cutting an object whose parts were modular and then assembled to achieve a structure in 3D. So designing in 2D to cut an object in 3D!</p>
                           <br><h4 align= left>Laser Cutting </h4> <img src="img/lesson3.1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I started the week looking at some completed projects with cutting machines, mainly with laser cutting, to get inspired about my exercise. I focused my research on           <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> and <a href="http://www.instructables.com">Instructables</a> and then some images on the web. At the end I decided to make a stand for my iPad.</p>
                             <img src="img/lesson3.2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>As for the previous week, to design in 2D I used Inkscape, following some tutorials to understand how to best set the edges and points to be embedded in a piece and another.</p>
                             <img src="img/lesson3.3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                             <img src="img/lesson3.4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>During the design had to also consider the instructions of the lab regarding the thickness of the sheets (3mm) of wood to be used and the kerf (0,12mm) of the laser cutting machine. All this has been necessary to design in a correct way the joints between the various parts.</p>
                            <img src="img/lesson3.5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                             <p>Before proceeding to define the edges and save the file in pdf format and then proceed to cut, I entered the FabLab logo and text to engrave on the surface where it will be based the iPad </p> 
                          <img src="img/lesson3.8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/lesson3.6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                             <img src="img/lesson3.7.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                     <p>After designing the stand, I continued with the cut. I saved the file in inkscape in dxf format and then i open it on Rhino (4 format) to start cutting. I had some problem with the speed of cutting, maybe because the wood sheet was deformed. So i had external lines cutted in some area and and not in other areas. To resove this problem i fixed a lower speed of cutting. An other problem was about the angle of a piece that overlaps the hole of another piece: a design problem. I learned that inkscape is a good software for design this kind of project but especially in case of design some angular holes it's better to use Rhino!</p>  
                              <img src="img/lesson3.9.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Once i resolved design problems i cutted again my project and after i assembled it. This is the result: </p>

                     <h4 align= left>Vinyl Cutting </h4>   
                            <p>During the exercise with the Vinyl Cutter I decided to make a sticker with the logo of my app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pipeline-app/id483483184?mt=8">Pipeline</a>. So I started from the vector logo made previously and I opened in Inkscape to fill the logo design and save it in SVG and DXF <img src="img/lesson3.14.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson3.15.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> Then I opened the project with Rhino to verify the accuracy of the drawing and in fact I had to fix it again before cutting <img src="img/lesson3.13.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> Before the cut I had to save the file in EPS format to allow the machine to read through software SignBlazer. Unfortunately and strangely the file was not complete, so I had to first open it and save it with CoreDraw in CMX format <img src="img/lesson3.17.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson3.18.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson3.19.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> The phase of the cut went according to plan: I set speed and pressure of the blade and booted the machine <img src="img/lesson3.16.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/131351997" width="700" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/131351997">Vinyl Cutter</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user25115924">Claudio Pecere</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p> <p>The last step was to remove the excess with the help of a utility knife and apply transparent tape to paste in the future the final object on a surface. This is the final result <img src="img/lesson3.23.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></p>

                           <p align="justify">During  <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html">Week 4</a> the goal was to make a FabISP in-circuit program. To do this it was necessary to choose one of two FABISP proposed during the weekly class, milling the board and the circuit, soldering the components and program the final ISP.</p> 
                            <img src="img/lesson4.1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="" style="float: right">  <img src="img/lesson4.2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                             <p align="justify"> For my weekly assingment I choose the ISP with the resonator, the left one of the pictures above. The process to mill the board could be done by two different method: Using the milling machine or with a Laser Cutter able to cut the copper and engrave the traces of the board. In my lab, at <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/labs/milan_od/index.html">OpenDot</a>, we tried the second way, as the milling machine doesn't work. We used a <a href="http://www.troteclaser.com/it-IT/Macchine-Laser/Medio/Pages/Speedy400flexx.aspx">Trotec Speedy 400 flexx</a> to engrave the board, this machine has both CO2 and fiber laser technologies: 60 watt CO2 laser, 30 watt fiber laser. <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/doc/fiber-laser-cutting-pcb.html">Here</a> you can find the description of the process and experiments done in the lab on machinery.</p> <img src="img/lesson4.3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> <br> <p align="justify">To make my FabISP i download first the board sugested during the lesson 4, the board with the resonetor component. After, I modify the file .png with Gimp to replace tha white border with a black one. Before start the cutting machine, I opened the board file with Inkscape to customize it with a vector part and to put a red line on the border for the cut level.The experiment done on the laser cutter </p>  <img src="img/lesson4.4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="" style="float: right">  <img src="img/lesson4.5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> <p align="justify">The experiments on the laser cutter defined settings to be set on Trotec for a fine engraving of the board, so after setting right levels, power and number of cut steps (fiber to engrave and CO2 to cut), the production process could begin. <img src="img/lesson4.6.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson4.7.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="" style="float: right">  <img src="img/lesson4.8.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""></p> <p align="justify">After approximately half an hour, this is the final results. To remove the residue of the operation of engraving and cutting, I just passed the board gently with water and a sponge for prepared it to the soldering process of the components (following the Fab Academy <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/doc/index_english.html">Tutorials</a>). </p> <img src="img/lesson4.9.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> <p> <br> This is the layout of the FabISP <img src="img/lesson4.13.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </p> <p align="justify">And these are the components necessary for the board:</p>  <li align="justify"> n. 1 ATTiny 44 microcontroller</li>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>The exercise of this <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html">week</a> was to design and then print a small object in 3D and then scan and eventually print a real object. The first part of the exercise was achieved through Inkscape to draw the model in 2D. I wanted to create an object consisting of the 3D logo of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pipeline-app/id483483184?mt=8">Pipeline</a>, a mobile App I developed in the last year. Is an object that maybe in the future I might change it into a keychain, maybe when my App becomes famous!</p>
                                                        <img src="img/lesson5.1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <img src="img/lesson5.2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br> <p>After finishing the design in 2D on Inkscape I tried to make the model in 3D with SketchUp. Personally i think that this software is certainly easier to use but for a complex and professional design I think it is needed best software. So I saved my file in .dxf on Inkscape and then work it on SketchUp. This is the result of design process</p>
                            <img src="img/lesson5.3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <img src="img/lesson5.4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <img src="img/lesson5.5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>And this is the 3D printed final logo after loading .stl on Cura to generate the GCODE: </p><img src="img/lesson5.13.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson5.12.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br> <p>Regarding the exercise of scanning of a real object, I used the Kinect to capture the image of myself through the use of Skanect.</p>   <img src="img/lesson5.6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson5.7.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <p>From Skanect I exported the file in .stl that presented some imperfections but overall a good definition. After I worked the file with blender to change the solid by removing unnecessary parts and excess, fix imperfections with the sculpture mode and modify individual points and add a base of support with my name.</p><img src="img/lesson5.8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson5.9.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">                            <br> <img src="img/lesson5.11.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
<img src="img/lesson5.10.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
<p>Once I loaded the file to print in Cura I noticed that inside 3D object there were some holes and the letters of my name needed some supports to make a good print. So i modified the file in Rhino, better of Blender for deleting mesh and to doing a boulean difference to embedded my name into the base of the object </p> <img src="img/lesson5.14.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <p>Below the printer process and the final result of my self!</p> <img src="img/lesson5.15.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson5.16.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson5.17.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h2>Electronics design</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>The exercise of this <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html">week</a> was to redraw the echo hello-world board and add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor) check the design rules, and make it. As for the previous weeks I had to start my preparation beginning from 0. So I bought a book of electronics for beginners to become familiar with the basic principles of this discipline. Once learned the basics to perform the exercise I have been closely following the <a href="http://www.fabacademy.org/archives/2015/doc/electronics_design_eagle.html">tutorial</a> published in Fab Academy. The first step was to download eagle and begin to understand its characteristics. Later I added the libraries of components required.</p>  <img src="img/lesson6.1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson6.2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson6.3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>This is the final result with all component, led, button and links in the schematic view. <p/> <img src="img/lesson6.4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p> Once finished the schematic i worked on the board to draw trace to link all the components. I tried to choose the function "autorouter" but i prefered to draw manually all the trace and understand the feature of eagle in this phase.<p/> <img src="img/lesson6.5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <p>Once I link all the traces I remove all layers except the top and i saved the file in .png and modified it in gimp with the parameters suggested in the previous tutorial. </p> <img src="img/lesson6.6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson6.8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> <p>The last step was to enter a text and fill with white traces black. So the last image even if it expresses almost nothing, is the image to be used to realize materially the board with a milling machine. <img src="img/lesson6.7.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> To make the hello board with <a href="http://www.troteclaser.com/it-IT/Macchine-Laser/Medio/Pages/Speedy400flexx.aspx">Trotec Speedy 400 flexx</a> to engrave the board, as I did for the FabISP assignment (week 4), i needed to mantain white the traces, black the background and to add in Inkscape the red level to cut the board.  <img src="img/lesson6.9.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> Setting and laser process of the board was the same of the FabISP <img src="img/lesson6.10.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson6.11.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <br> And this is my first Hello Board, before and after soldering components!!!!<br> <br><img src="img/lesson6.12.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/lesson6.13.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><img src="img/lesson6.14.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></p>
