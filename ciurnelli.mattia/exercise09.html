  <h1><u> Lesson n. 9:</u><h2>Molding and Casting</h2></h1>
</div>

	<p>The assignment of the week is to design a 3D mold, machine it, and cast parts from it.</p>
            <h3>Ice Cube Yourself</h3>
            <p>Among the many workshops organized by Opendot there was "Ice Cube Yourself" in collaboration with Andrej Boleslavsky, an artist from Prague.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/Icecubeyourself.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
        <p>The goal of the workshop was make a mold to realize ice cubes with the shape of its face, starting from a 3d scanning.</p>
            <p>For 3d scanning we used the same procedure of the <a href="exercise05.html">week 5</a>, but this time we used the new version of Kinect: this has a resolution three times greater than the first, but it is only compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/scansionekinect.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>The interface of the scanning software is simple and intuitive, and allows you to adjust the scanning parameters according to environmental requirements.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/programmascansione.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>After scanning all the participants, we have modified the mesh obtained in order to retain only the faces of the people.</p>
            <p>These are the faces obtained:</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/softwareDWS1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>For 3D print the faces and reach results of higher level, instead of using the Prusa, we used the DWS Digital Wax: this SLA printer has an greater accuracy than the FDA printers, but the time of printing is more long.</p>
            <p>The software of DWS is a bit more complicated than those seen until now, which is understandable given the precision applications that has this machine.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/softwareDWS.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>The printer has a print speed of about 1 cm / hour (the height of the model) but the results are noticeably better than the Prusa (obviously).</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/risultato_stampa.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/fine_stampa3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/fine_stampa.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/fine_stampa2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>The objects once outside the printers are not yet ready, must be first cleaned using pure alcohol to remove excess resin</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/pulizia_stampa.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>then be removed from the plate of the printer using an appropriate "comb"</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/distacco_stampe.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>and finally, should be placed in a special UV-rays oven to permanently solidify the resin on the surface.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/fornoUV.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/fornoUV_interno.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>This is the result of objects once out of the oven:</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/volti_finali.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/dettaglio_stampa.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once ready the objects we started working on how to make the mold.
We made a box with laser cutting in which to place the faces and then pouring the silicon.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/preparazione_stampo2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/preparazione_stampo.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once closed and sealed box we started to prepare the silicone.
since the final use of the mold will be with ice, we used Smooth-SIL® 940 that is suitable For food and related application. This product consists of 2 parts: the silicone and a catalyst. In this case, using Smooth-Sil® 940 the 2 components are mixed 100A (silicone) : 10B (catalyst) by weight.</p>
            <p>When mixed evenly the two components we poured the silicone in the mold.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/colata_silicone.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/3dmold.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once past 24 hours, ie the "curing time", the mold is ready to be used and can be removed from the box..</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/risultato_stampo.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>We poured water into the mold, and we put it in the freezer, and this is the result:</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/risultato_ghiaccio2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/risultato_ghiaccio.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Using water the details were lost due to transparency, so we made another attempt using coffee:</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/risultato_caffe.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            
            <h3>Milling a Mold</h3>
            <p>As a task of the week, we had to create a mold, by milling a block of wax. To do this, I chose a 3D model easy to implement, I imported in MeshLab and simplified to make the file more light</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/kenny_iniziale.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once the file is exported from MeshLab, I imported in Rhino, where I started to work to realize the positive mold, which will go then milled into the wax. First I divided the mesh into 2 parts, so you have two molds at the end, and placed them on two surfaces on which I applied on one side 4 cylinder and on the other 4 holes: these elements will then serve, once It made the mold, to match them.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/split_in_part.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Then I created the walls of the block of wax, so as to keep separated the two blocks.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/final_mold_kenny.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once ready the model, I exported as ".stl" and imported PartWork3D to prepare files for milling. First, we set the orientation and size of the model (which in my case are the dimensions of the material).</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/orientation_and_size_model.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Subsequently you have to set the size of the material (which as mentioned above are the same with those of the model), the origin and the eventual tab.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/material_size_and_margin.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once finished setting measures of model and material, we move to the development of the toolpath, one for roughing and one for finishing.</p>
            <p>First, it is estimated that of roughing. For this work, I used a 1/8 inch drill bit, with the following parameters:</p>
            <ul type=square>
                <li>Pass Depth: 0.1 inches</li>
                <li>Stepover: 0.05 inches</li>
                <li>Spindle Speed: 10000 r.p.m.</li>
                <li>Feed Rate: 15 mm/s</li>
                <li>Plunge Rate: 8.0 mm/s</li>
                <li>Rapid Cleareance Gap: 5.0 mm</li>
                <li>Machining Allowance: 0,5 mm</li>
                <li>Strategy: Z Level --> Raster X</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/roughing_toolpath.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once finished with the roughing, I switched to calculating the finishing toolpath, this time using the following parameters and a 3 mm ball nose tip:</p>
            <ul type=square>
                <li>Stepover: 0.3 mm</li>
                <li>Spindle Speed: 10000 r.p.m.</li>
                <li>Feed Rate: 10.0 mm/s</li>
                <li>Plunge Rate: 5.0 mm/s</li>
                <li>Rapid Cleareance Gap: 5.0 mm</li>
                <li>Raste Angle: 45 degrees</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/finishing_toolpath.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once processed both toolpath, I've exported and got ready to mill the wax block.
I set the block to the work plane, using pieces of wood in each side.</p>
            <p>Once secured to the block plan, I imported the roughing toolpath and I did start</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/sgrossatura1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/sgrossatura2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>This is the result after the roughing</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/fine_sgrossatura.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Immediately after finishing the initial processing, I imported and started the finishing toolpath</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/finishing1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>This is the result after the finishing</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/final_finishing.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once finished, I cleaned the block by any remnants of wax and I started to prepare the silicone rubber to obtain the mold.</p>
            <p>The silicone rubber is obtained by mixing two components: the first or the rubber itself and the second which is a hardener.</p>
            <p>The two components are mixed according to the following proportions: 100 silicone rubber: 5 hardening.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/gomma_siliconica.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/indurente.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Once prepared the proportions, we must quickly stir and pour into the mold, as more time passes the more rubber hardens.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/colata.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>After ten hours the mold is ready to be removed from the block of wax, this is the obtained result:</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/stampi.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>Before pouring the resin into the mold just obtained, I created a small box of plywood with the laser cutter, in order to keep the 2 mold applies the mold united in a uniform manner.</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/box_lasercutter.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/box_stampo.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>When the mold and the box to contain it are ready, I mixed the two components of the resin (50% part A - 50% part B) and the I casting in the mold</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/colata_resina.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>After half an hour the resin is already cured, and you can proceed to open the mold</p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/apertura_stampo.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p class="pic"><img src= "Image/Lesson09/apertura_stampo2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"></p>
            <p>This is the final result</p>
