        <p>I'm arrive to complete more than i had thinked at the biginning of this project. I have gone beyond a lot of technical problems that I would not sincerely believe to be able to resolve.<br> From my point of view all of that I was appointed to develop has been completed. The Photogrammetric Fab Scanner exists equipped with all the elements that I expected. Unfortunately after their realization, some elements are revealed weak or not suficently precise respect of the tecnical exigense of the project. This means that the project require a new step of development. And this is the reasion for why i do not upload a video of the working project.I will uploas it erlier when the V1 of the Photogrammetric Fab Scan will be ready</p>
        <br>

             </p>
        
        
        
        <p>Remain to complet the "Scanner Control System" a sort of remote control of the machine, that i start to develop. I's a system that give the possibility to control the differnts part of the system. Separately.</p>
        <p> This box contains: One ATX power supply that i use for : <br><br> 1 - feed  the system of light LED. I use 2 electrical swich for power on separately the FRONT LED LIGHT - used for lighting the object to scann- and the  BACK LED LIGHT - used for lighting the back ground of the box <br><br>  2- I also need 12V power for the little 5 inc monitor, that give me the possibility to visualise the video out signal of the camera. <br><br> 3- The ATX power supply give me also the possibility to have 5V for power on my micocontroller board. <br><br> 4- One separate 4.5V power supply is inside of the box for feed the videocamera. <br><br>Each periferic is ON OFF swichable whit same buttons.<br> I provided 1 bottom for  the reset buttom of microcontroller and one Red Led Light that show me how the camera working <br> i would like to integrate the "control box to the top part of the scanner.</p>
        
        
        
        <br><br>
        
        
<p>The more bigger problems that I have met are :</p> <br>
        
        <p>1- The plywood 5mm structure of the box is not sufficiently resistant : the nature of the structure, cylindrical with vertical uppercuts, it is not proper for support the strengths and the tensions produced by the weight of the rail and the camera support. Also, the tensions produced by the motor system of traction used for the muve the camera in the rail,  make that the structure flex on itself.If I had not brought correction changes whit a C wood structure, is would be collapsed on  it self.</p>

        <br>
        
        
        
        <p>2- The alluminium curved rail that i bild by myself in the fablab is obviously few linear. This ago that the camera moves  with same attrition in the rail. This problem is relatively secondary, seen that the movement of the camera in the rail doesn't necessarily be fluid. The attrition however incrase the tensions, that added to the fragil nature of the wood structure surely increases the unstable movimentation of th camera support in the rail</p>

        <p>The problems related to the structure have same easy solution: I have not decided yet which is the best new design solution for the structure, but probably the vertical uppercuts of the next prototype will be 8mm thread bar. Or always in plywood, but milled from 1.2mm hard wood. The metallic 8mm thread bar, will give me the possiblità to climb on and to get off more easily the structure and probably to make it more rigid, to damage of an increase of the weight of the scanner.morover  i think  to integrate the temporary solution used for rigidify the structure in the new prototype and use it like a transport handle.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>for what it concerns the bending of the rail, It exist different and expensive solutions in commerce. From the system Igus to the water cutter of an aluminum profile.</p><p>Maybe another and more DIY solution could be to abandon the idea of a concave alluminium rail, that also works like guide of the wheels and reverse the concept: use some plexiglass of 8mm to create the rail and modify the wheels with un external supports and use it like a rail guide</p>

        <p>During the next month of September I will start again working to this prototype: my objective will be to get a version of the PHOTOGRAMMETRIC FAB SCANNER 1.0. I am absolutely sure that will succeed in the intent to do a stable version  and perfectly working prototipe of it : -)</p>

        <br>    
        <br>
        <p>What I have learned in this process of development of prototype, as along as the formative road af the Fab Academy path is  vast complex and important. More then the competences acquired in digital fabbrication, electronics and coding, I have understood the importance of planning and organization of the times. </p>
        <p>It's not a secret for me that every week, systematically, i was confronted  with the difficulty to manage the times : time of planning the exercise, the time of realize it and times for the documentation. There was never enough time for doing better the exercises.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        
        
        
        <p>Every way, I am   extremely happy of work that i do and the competences thet i have acquired in this path. It is certain that the part of "digital fabbrication" results me easier and more closed of my nature. I like "do things" and look the phisical nature of it. Electronic is really intresting too : i love the possibility to do my own circuit, program it for do what i wont. Of corse is really difficult have a good level of competences to be autonumus ; and choose and use the good componets for making that your board do what you want, need years of study. However a pcb bord is a fisical object : you can look it you can tuch it. The therd part of the coursus is the coding and progammation part : and is sure the most difficult for me. The code is not phisical is difficult imaginate it and foretell the effect of it. On reallity is the part of study that intrigue me. I do not spent much time for it because seen my complete inexperience i need to much time to grow in it.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        
        <br>
        
        <p>The discourse concludes it as starts: with a reflection about the time. <p>
        <br>
        </p>The time that is never enough, if it doesn't controlled in a virtus way, that develop it in the most profitable direction of your intents.</p>
