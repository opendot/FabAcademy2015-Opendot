			<div class="weeks">
				<p>
				During this week I've learned about <span class="redones">principles and practices, project management</span>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Digital fabrication is not new to me as I've already watched some videos about it and the Neil's speeches, but I'm really excited about the course that is starting. Digital fabrication, as a lot of other things that we then discover, is inspired by nature. But, what here is making the difference, is the fact that we are talking about one of the best feature that nature has built-in: <span class="redones">self-reproduction</span>. I was thinking about computer's CPU and memory as organizers of electrons via small quantified amounts of electricity, and due to this I was imagining a program as an ordered bunch of electrons groups. When I learned about digital fabrication this point of view became obsolete as we are now at the next step:  <span class="redones">a piece of code does not just describe a thing, it's a thing itself. </span>
				</p><br>
				<p>Do you like this  <span class="redones">site</span>?</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Even if I'm a IT engineer, I'm not familiar with <span class="redones">web development</span> because I often work with backend's services and components. So I like the fact I had the opportunity to study a bit of this kind of things. I prefer big fonts to help readability, and I don't like pages full of text or little details, I just want to put only the things that are strictly needed and nothing else. The same strategy I will use for additional web components. Also, if you don't want to read all the text, you can just <span class="redones">follow the red words</span> to understand the main keywords and topics of the page you are looking at.
				To edit <span class="redones">HTML</span> and <span class="redones">CSS</span> Massimo suggested us to use <span class="redones">Brackets</span>. I tried Brackets a bit, but I quickly discovered that I wasn't familiar with the text colors of the Brackets' themes. Also I missed the document text preview on the right side. So I ended up with <span class="redones">Sublime</span>, a lightweight HTML editor that we use sometimes at work.</p>
				<p>Here is a comparison of the two editors:</p><br>
				<img src="img/editors.jpeg" style="size=80%" alt="editors">
				<p><br>To effectively test in locale my web pages I used the web server <span class="redones">nginx</span>. 
				Via APT I easily installed nginx:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">sudo apt-get install nginx</pre></p>
				<p>Then I changed its document root with the path of my directory inside my local git FabAcademy repository. To do this I edited the nginx configuration file of the default site:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/deafult</pre></p>
				<p> and replaced the line:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">root /usr/share/nginx/html;</pre></p>
				<p>with:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">root /home/satsha/git/FabAcademy2015-Opendot/ingrassia.daniele;</pre></p>
				<p>In the nginx configuration file this line is inside the server block, so this path is considered the starting point of all the locations (url paths) of this server block. In this case only the default location "/" was present. I also changed the <span class="redones">port</span> of the default server block from 8080 to 8081, because I may already have other services on the 8080:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">listen 8081 default_server;</pre></p>
				<p>Then, file saved and back on bash, I started nginx with:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">sudo service nginx start</pre></p>
				<p>And at</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://127.0.0.1:8081</pre></p>
				<p>browser successfully showed me my test index.html:</p>
				<img src="img/test_index.jpeg" alt="editors">
				<p>At this point I was ready to start with HTML and CSS development. First I headed to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="redones">W3Schools</span></a> to revise the <span class="redones">structure</span> of a web page and some of the HTML tags that Massimo teached us about:</p>


				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lthtml&gt &lt!-- define an HTML document --&gt<br> &lthead&gt &lt!-- document's meta data --&gt<br>  &lttitle&gtTitle of the document&lt/title&gt<br> &lt/head&gt<br> &ltbody&gt &lt!-- document's content --&gt<br>  &ltsection&gt &lt!-- section --&gt<br>   &ltdiv&gt &lt!-- division --&gt<br>    &ltp&gtsome text&lt/p&gt &lt!-- paragraph --&gt<br>    &lta href="http://www.fabacademy.org"&gt&lt/a&gt &lt!--hyperlink--&gt<br>    &ltimg src="image.jpg"&gt&lt/img&gt &lt!--image--&gt<br>    &ltul&gtList title &lt!-- unordered list --&gt<br>     &ltli&gtlist item&lt/li&gt &lt!--list item--&gt<br>   &lt/ul&gt<br>   &lt/div&gt<br>  &lt/section&gt<br> &lt/body&gt<br>&lt/html&gt</pre></p>


				<p>Then I analyzed how to <span class="redones">reference</span> a specific HTML tag:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&ltp id="id1" class="class1"&gtsome text&lt/p&gt &lt!-- paragraph --&gt</pre></p>				
				<p>The difference between <span class="redones">id</span> and <span class="redones">class</span> is that id identifies only one object, while a class identifies a group of objects. Here it is how to reference these identifiers inside <span class="redones">CSS</span>:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-html">body{} /* apply style inside body tag */<br>.class1 {} /* apply style on all the object that belong t class1 */<br>#id1 {} /* apply style on all the object with id id1 */</pre></p>

				<br>
				<p>What about <span class="redones">git</span>?</p><br>
				<p>We often use git at work, so I'm not new of this kind of <span class="redones">distributed version control</span>. However I was happy (when I was able of!) to help my fellow students whenever they needed. To sync with our intermediate <span class="redones">repository</span> and <span class="redones">push</span> my modifications I followed these steps.
				</p>
				<p>First I cloned the repository locally:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">git clone https://github.com/opendot/FabAcademy2015-Opendot.git</pre></p>
				<p>Then I added my site inside my own folder, and added it and its files to <span class="redones">virtual index</span>:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">git add -A .</pre></p>
				<p>With the modifications inside virtual index, I can now <span class="redones">commit</span> to my local repository:</p>
				<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">git commit -m "first commit of daniele ingrassia's website"</pre></p>
				<p>Just before pushing I <span class="redones">pull</span>ed, so I'm sure that if anybody in the meanwhile made any push I get his modifications:</p><p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">git pull origin master</pre></p>
				<p>Finally I pushed my modifications on the remote repository:</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">git push origin master</pre></p>

				<p>This week I've learned about <span class="redones">computer-aided design</span>.</p>

				<p>Apart from a few and simple experiments with Blender, I've never used <span class="redones">CAD</span> or <span class="redones">rendering</span> software. At the beginning of the week, Massimo told us that we would have talked only about a subset of the long list of the software presented in MIT lecture. So, I've first started with installing such software, and, since I'm on Linux, I could not install all of them directly, but I had to use my Windows virtual machine. Here is a table with the main features of the software Massimo introduced us:</p>

				</table> 
				 <p><br><span class="redones">Inkscape</span> was one of the first software that I tried out. It was very easy to learn and in short time I was able to easily manage how to use the vectors' control points:</p>
  				 <p><img src="img/inkscape.jpeg"></p>
  				 <p>After some use of Inkscape I thought that it wasn't the right choice for designing something precise, like the drone I want to build or a part of it. If I need to 3D print parts, or to measure distance between points, the best is to use a 2D/3D CAD software. Accordingly to this I  decided to try <span class="redones">FreeCad</span>. FreedCad was very good, and also relatively easy to me. The problem was that FreeCad is a beta, and I experienced some errors and chrashes in the middle of the work that made me consider this software not a reliable choice. I also briefly tried <span class="redones">QCad</span>, but after FreedCad it seemed to be too simple for the scope I had. The lastest software in the Massimo's list that is specialized in 2D CAD is <span class="redones">DraftSight</span>. Since it's a clone of the famous Autocad, and therefore inherits its commands, I felt comfortable with DraftSight both at the beginning and then when I tried to use more advanced commands. I decided to use DraftSight for <span class="redones">2D technical drawing</span>.</p>
				
  				 <p>Here is the design of the drone's <span class="redones">frame</span> and its dimensions, made with DraftSight(<a href="drawings/frame2D.dwg"><span class="redones" style="font-weight: bold;">download</span></a>):<br></p>
  				 <p><img src="img/frame2D_web.gif"></p>
  				 <p><br>Furthermore, because of the special <span class="redones">assembly</span>  feature the drones have, I also tried to design the <span class="redones">cubic frame</span>(<a href="drawings/cubic_frame2D.dwg"><span class="redones" style="font-weight: bold;">download</span></a>):<br><br></p>
				 <p><img src="img/cage2D_web.gif"></p>
				 <p><br>When I saw these drawings clompleted, I could not wait to see them <span class="redones">rendered in 3D</span>! As a strategy I was thinking about exporting the 2D technical drawings I made to svg format, and then doing an import in  <span class="redones">Blender</span>. At the first usages of Blender I was advantaged by the little experiences of the past. But then it was a nightmare: I get lost in countless commands that Blender has and also I encountered some bugs of the boolean modifier. So, as a last chance for 3D I tried <span class="redones">Rhino</span> three months trial in the Windows virtual machine. Despite a non easy start, and after some difficulties, I really appreciated Rhino. So taken further by the desire to render the 2D technical drawings I managed to correctly import the svg files, extruded the surfaces, and reached the goal to decently render them, with the compliance of the dimensions!</p>
				 <p>So, here you can see the surfaces just before <span class="redones">extrusion</span>:<br><br></p>
				 <p><img src="img/planar_surfaces.png"></p>
				 <p>Here is the final 3D rendering of the frame(<a href="drawings/frame3D.rar"><span class="redones" style="font-weight: bold;">download</span></a>):<br><br></p>
				 <p><img stile="size:70%" src="img/frame3D_web.jpg"></p>
				 <p><br>And here is the 3D rendering of the cubic frame(<a href="drawings/cubic_frame3D.rar"><span class="redones" style="font-weight: bold;">download</span></a>):<br><br></p>
				 <p><img src="img/cage3D_web.jpg"></p>
				 <p><br> Finally you can <span class="redones">play</span> with last one:</p>

		<section id= "week3" class="row">
			<div class="photo-grid">
				<p>In this week we've talked about <span class="redones">computer-controlled cutting</span>.</p>
				<ul class="lists">
				<li>There are different <span class="redones">cutting techniques</span>, of which the main ones are:</li>
				<li><span class="redones">Vinyl cutting</span>, cheap and simple cutting technology, can cut soft materials like paper and vinyl</li>
				<li><span class="redones">Laser cutting</span>, one of the most spread technologies, can cut materials like wood, PMMA and engrave metals</li>
				<li><span class="redones">Water jet cutting</span>, expensive technology that can cut hard materials like marbles and metals</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Some <span class="redones">principal facts</span> that are needed to know about cutting techniques are relative on how they work. One of these regards the cut: because it have a non zero width, it will destroy thin strips of material around itself. So if we need to cut something in a very precise way, we have to estimate this value to obtain the exact dimensions we want. The width of a cut is called <span class="redones">kerf</span>. Another one is that, even if we get a two dimensional cut, we can combine several cuts to assembly 3D objects and shapes. This can be done, for example, with <span class="redones">joints</span> in order to make a box, or cutting several <span class="redones">layers</span> of different dimensions and stacking them up. An important thing to know about laser is that the shape of a laser cut is not perfectly straight but tends to be a <span class="redones">cone</span>. This effect is more evident by cutting thicker materials.</p> 

				<p>After Wednesday's lecture and Thursday's theory lesson we had the opportunity to see our <span class="redones">laser cutter</span> (a GCC Laser Pro) in action. As first experiment we made some simple cuts on a 3mm scrap piece of plywood. There were alot of details to memorize on how to use this (or in general a) laser cutter, so I decided to write here a brief <span class="redones">step by step guide</span>:</p>				
				<p><span class="redones">1.</span> remove any material already present on the cutting grid
				<br><span class="redones">2.</span> remove any leavings remained in the cutting grid, or below it
				<br><span class="redones">3.</span> place new material on the cutting grid
				<br><span class="redones">4.</span> check if the material is bent (for example wood) and attempt to lock it in order to minimize bending
				<br><span class="redones">5.</span> turn on the laser cutter
				<br><span class="redones">6.</span> calibrate Z axis (height of laser lens) if the previous cut was made with different material
				<br><span class="redones">7.</span> manually place the lens in a desired point, if you want to use a custom starting point
				<br><span class="redones">8.</span> close the protective lid
				<br><span class="redones">9.</span> turn on the filtering system for the material you want to work with
				<br><span class="redones">10.</span> go to PC and open the file you want to print
				<br><span class="redones">11.</span> if necessary assign different layers to different parts of the drawing
				<br><span class="redones">12.</span> put settings for each layer (mainly power, speed values and check vector, raster and air) if needed
				<br><span class="redones">13.</span> put other settings like print area and home position
				<br><span class="redones">14.</span> optionally do a test on a small square of material to check if settings are ok
				<br><span class="redones">15.</span> hit print button
				<br><span class="redones">16.</span> go to the machine's display and select the file to print
				<br><span class="redones">17.</span> start cutting by pressing start button
				<br><span class="redones">18.</span> turn off the laser cutter and filtering system at the end of the cut </p>

				<p>After this first experiment, together with Simone Boasso and Mattia Ciurnelli, we tried to <span class="redones">measure the kerf</span> of our laser cutter. To do this we cutted another 3mm scrap piece of plywood as follows:</p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/kerf_test.jpg"></p>
				<p>Then we obtained the kerf with the formula shown in the following picture:</p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/kerf.jpg"></p>
				<p>Settings of the driver were: power 100% and speed 10%. The resulting kerf is <span class="redones">0.12mm</span>. Kerf depends on speed and power of the laser beam and by thickness and type of material. In fact, these values are only a starting point useful to estimate future kerfs for the same or similar conditions.</p>
				<p>Another interesting test made by me and Simone Boasso, was about trying to find the best combination of sizes in order to obtain <span class="redones">wood joints</span>, that will firmly block each other when fitted together. To do this test we made the following drawing(<a href="drawings/week3/joints_test.rar"><span class="redones" style="font-weight: bold;">download</span></a>):</p> 

				<p><img src="img/week3/joints_file.jpg"></p>

				<p>Where the numbers identify the exact <span class="redones">size of the holes or of the fillings</span>, accordingly with the piece on which they are printed on. We decided to use the kerf measured before, as the single step to increase or decrease the sizes. The first attempt to cut this drawing onto a 6mm plywood has <span class="redones">failed to cut</span> all with settings of power 100% and speed 5%:</p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/first_joints_cut.jpg"></p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/second_joints_cut.jpg"></p>

				<p>The second try was successful as we lowered speed to 3.4%. Here is the video of our successful cut:</p>

				<iframe  src="//player.vimeo.com/video/119747304" width="700" height="450" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>

				<p><br>You can also notice, as you already seen in the drawing, that with that cut we also tried to <span class="redones">engrave some raster and vector</span> numbers, for these we used the settings of power 100% and speed 80%. Furthermore, to improve precision, we made these engravings before the cuts, to be sure that wood was not moved before. The last part of the test was about to try every <span class="redones">permutation of joints</span> with the pieces we've made:</p>
				<iframe  src="//player.vimeo.com/video/119747305" width="700" height="450" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>
				
				<p><br>We also tried to test the wood joints with one of the pieces flipped. This because we want to test how much the cuts made by the laser tend to be a cone. Finally the best permutation for a wood joint was the <span class="redones">filling of 10.12mm with the hole of 9.64mm</span>.</p>

				<p>For my personal experimentations with laser cutting I was thinking about to make an <span class="redones">adjustable notebook stand</span>. I wanted to make this because my notebook often warms up very quickly, forcing me to put something below it to help cooling. The main idea is to realize a rectangular top, perforated for the most to help notebook breathing and supported by two lateral pieces, specially shaped to hold the rectangular top and allow some inclination.</p>

				<ul class="lists">
				<li>Starting from this idea, I made the following <span class="redones">considerations</span>:</li>
				<li>rectangular top must be capable to <span class="redones">support different sizes</span>, so I measured different notebooks from 10" to 17"</li>
				<li>to avoid any future warping I preferred to use 8mm plywood</li>
				<li>lateral pieces must allow breathing to the air intakes on all sides, as well allow to use all sides' connections</li>
				<li>this notebook stand can be used also as <span class="redones">reading desk</span>, so I can use an higher inclination for the last regulation</li>
				<li>plywood offers good sliding friction to the notebook</li>
				<li>I don't take kerf in consideration because of with 8mm plywood and fillings of centimeters the joints will be solid</li>
				<li>one of the joints must be capable of <span class="redones">rotation</span>, so I need to cut a little cylinder around it to help rotation</li>
				<li>as a reinforcement I need to put another piece below the rectangular top, this piece must not bother spaces</li>
				<li>I want the possibility to pass the cables through the rectangular top</li>
				<li>the rectangular top is most stressed longitudinally, so I designed it more resistant on that (irregular circumference)</li>
				<li>to avoid falling of smaller notebook I can fill the central part of rectangular top with two X shaped wood strips</li>
				<li>to reinforce all I can cut some little wood indentations and put there some <span class="redones">o-rings</span></li>
				<li>I want to change inclination of the rectangular top without disassembling all</li>
				<li>the space below the rectangular top can be used to place a power supply, an external hard disk etc.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Here is the original <span class="redones">drawing</span> of the notebook stand(<a href="drawings/week3/notebook_stand_quote.rar"><span class="redones" style="font-weight: bold;">download</span></a>):</p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/notebook_stand_quote.gif"></p>
				<p>And here is the drawing just before print to <span class="redones">optimize spaces</span> and the quantity of wood used:</p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/notebook_stand.gif"></p>
				<p>The settings for my cut were: power 100% and speed 1.4%. This is our laser cutter while <span class="redones">cutting</span> the notebook stand:</p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/during.jpg"></p>
				<p>And finally here are the <span class="redones">results</span>, all the pieces that constitute the notebook stand:</p>
				<p><img src="img/week3/disassembled.jpg"></p>
				
				<p>The notebook stand is <span class="redones">solid</span>, easy to assemble/disassemble, it doesn't require complete disassemble to <span class="redones">change inclination</span> and can be safely used also without o-rings. The following pictures show the item assembled, used in different <span class="redones">configurations with and without o-rings.</span>.</p>

				<p>Final Project: <span class="redones">concept</span></p>

				<p>
				We are by now invaded by <span class="redones">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</span>. They spread everywhere and for whatever kind of use, from taking an aerial video of a party to flying over a raging forest fire alerting firefighters, from hovering over a construction site conducting a building inspection to exploring dangerous places like war sites.</p>

				<img class="images" src="img/drone_fire.jpeg">
				<img class="images" src="img/drone_inspect.jpeg">
			
				<p>The use of such flying robotics in the form of small UAVs, also known as <span class="redones">drones</span>, is pervasive now but not only: its <span class="redones">commercial growth</span> is predicted to <span class="redones">significantly increase</span> and reach several tens billions of dollars worldwide over the next years.</p>
				<img class="images1" src="img/drones_market.jpeg">
				
				<p>However, in order to achieve this market increase, a multitude of <span class="redones">issues</span> needs to be addressed and several <span class="redones">improvements</span> need to be done. For example, talking about security, the drones on the market today don’t have anything that complain with obstacle avoidance, so they easily get crashed on people and things by inexperienced pilots. Furthermore, they don’t present any kind of mechanism to cooperate each other, or to obtain smarter behaviours.</p>
				<img class="images" src="img/drone_crash.jpg">

				
				<ul class="lists">
				<li>Accordingly to above examples, and due to my interest on <span class="redones">A.I.</span>, what I want to do is to make a drone with such capabilities. So my goal is to acquire all the know-how on the today’s drones to build a <span class="redones">smart quadcopter</span> that offers the following extras:</li>
				<li><span class="redones">obstacle avoidance</span></li>
				<li><span class="redones">cooperation capabilities</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The concept of cooperation I want to realize is intended as another use of the drones:  <span class="redones">the drones as building block material</span> that can be modularly and autonomously assembled.
				In this direction I think at this quadcopter like a normal one, but equipped with <span class="redones">advanced</span> hardware and software <span class="redones">components</span>, and surrounded by a cage, in order to apply more sensors and to enable an autonomous assembly behaviour. I think about the cage as a <span class="redones">light cubic frame</span> for simplicity of drones assembling.</p>
				
				<p> The acronym I have chosen for this drone is <span class="redones"> AAVOID</span>:<span class="redones"> A</span>utonomous <span class="redones"> A</span>ssembly a<span class="redones">VOI</span>ding <span class="redones">D</span>rone</p>
				
				<p>Here is a draft schema of the <span class="redones">Control Unit</span>'s hardware architecture:</p>
