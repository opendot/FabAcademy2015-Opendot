				We are by now invaded by <span class="redones">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</span>. They spread everywhere and for whatever kind of use, from taking an aerial video of a party to flying over a raging forest fire alerting firefighters, from hovering over a construction site conducting a building inspection to exploring dangerous places like war sites. </p>
				<br>
				<img class="images" src="img/drone_fire.jpeg">
				<img class="images" src="img/drone_inspect.jpeg">
				<br>
				<p>The use of such flying robotics in the form of small UAVs, also known as <span class="redones">drones</span>, is pervasive now but not only: its <span class="redones">commercial growth</span> is predicted to <span class="redones">significantly increase</span> and reach several tens billions of dollars worldwide over the next years.</p>
				<img class="images1" src="img/drones_market.jpeg">
				<br>
				<p>However, in order to achieve this market increase, a multitude of <span class="redones">issues</span> needs to be addressed and several <span class="redones">improvements</span> need to be done. For example, talking about security, the drones on the market today don’t have anything that complain with obstacle avoidance, so they easily get crashed on people and things by inexperienced pilots. Furthermore, they don’t present any kind of mechanism to cooperate each other, or to obtain smarter behaviours.</p>
				<img class="images" src="img/drone_crash.jpg">

				
				<ul class="lists">
				<li>Accordingly to above examples, and due to my interest on <span class="redones">A.I.</span>, what I want to do is to make a drone with such capabilities. So my goal is to acquire all the know-how on the today’s drones to build a <span class="redones">smart quadcopter</span> that offers the following extras:</li>
				<li><span class="redones">obstacle avoidance</span></li>
				<li><span class="redones">cooperation capabilities</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The concept of cooperation I want to realize is intended as another use of the drones:  <span class="redones">the drones as building block material</span> that can be modularly and autonomously assembled.
				In this direction I think at this quadcopter like a normal one, but equipped with <span class="redones">advanced</span> hardware and software <span class="redones">components</span>, and surrounded by a cage, in order to apply more sensors and to enable an autonomous assembly behaviour. I think about the cage as a <span class="redones">light cubic frame</span> for simplicity of drones assembling.</p>
				<ul class="lists">
				<li> The acronym I have chosen for this drone is <span class="redones"> AAVOID</span>: </li>
				<li><span class="redones"> A</span>utonomous <span class="redones"> A</span>ssembly a<span class="redones">VOI</span>ding <span class="redones">D</span>rone</li>

				In this week i learned about <span class="redones">principles and practices, project management</span>.
				<br><br>
				Honestly i already watched some videos about digital fabrication and Neil's speeches so i'm not surprised, but for sure im excited on what we are going to start. Digital fabrication, as a lot of other things that we discover, is inspired by nature. But, what here is making the difference, is the fact that we are talking about one of the best feature that nature has built-in: <span class="redones">self-reproduction</span>. I was thinking about computer's CPU and memory as organizers of electrons via small quantified amounts of electricity, and due to this I was imagining a program as an ordered bunch of electrons groups. When i learned about digital fabrication this point of view has become obsolete as we now have the next step of this:  <span class="redones">a piece of code not just describe a thing, it's a thing itself. </span>

				<br>
				<br>
				Do you like this  <span class="redones">site </span>?
				<br><br>
				Even if i'm a Information Technology engineer, i'm not familiar with html and css because i often work with backend's services and components. So i liked this part in which i had the opportunity the study a bit of these things. I prefer big fonts to help readability, and don't like pages full of text or little details, i just want to put only the things that are strictly needed and nothing else. The same strategy i will use for additional web components. Also, if you don't want to read all the text, you can just <span class="redones">follow the red words</span> to understand the main keywords and topics of the page you are looking.
				<br><br>
				What about <span class="redones">git</span>?
				<br>
				<br>
				We often use git at work, so i'm not new of this kind of <span class="redones">distributed version control</span>. However i was happy (when i was able of!) to help my fellow students when they needed.
