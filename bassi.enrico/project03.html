    <h2>Final project: Development</h2>
        
       
                <h3>Electronic</h3>
	<p>
The board is designed based on the schematic of the CNC board by <a href="https://ryanpourcillie.files.wordpress.com" target="_blank"> Ryan Pourcillie</a>
        <img src="images/original_board.JPG" width="900">
        
        <br> 
        His schematic was mainly useful as a reference for the capacitors used and the solution used. 
        <br>
        Here the schematic I made, based on his:
        <img src="images/board1.jpg">
        <br>
        
        And here the board:
         <img src="images/board2.jpg">
        <br>
        <a href="media/smill.zip">
	<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Download "S-mill board V1"</button>
	</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        
        It was pretty easy to connect almost everythig, these are the main issues:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>One of the traces must pass on the corner of ATMEGA 328P</li>
        <li>The endstops hve no external pull-up resistors (i hope to fix this using the internal ones)</li>
        <li>The enable of the stepper drivers and one of the endstop must be connected with jumpers</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      <p>
        <br>
        Beside be careful in placing the traces in the center of the corner, I did a small modification on the shape of the pad in inkscape, just to have a little bit more room. So here it is the original image:
        <img src="images/details2.jpg">
      
          
        And here the small adjustment done in inkscape:
        <img src="images/details3.jpg">
        
        I had no problem to solder the ATMEGA 328p without shortcircuiting anything.
        <br>
To make the board a little bit easier to read, I add some simple "silks" (like "GND", "Z - Axis", "+", etc.). They're pretty fragile, but still useful to have.
          <br>
          <img src="images/details10.jpg">
          
Here the jumper used:
          <img src="images/details13.jpg">
          <img src="images/details15.jpg">
          
          <br>
          The driver used are the DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver, that can get to 1,5 A without cooling. I'll probably need more current, but it coul work for the tests. To improve the performances I added a passive cooler
          <img src="images/details16.jpg">
          
          <br>
          The board has a connector for the FTDI and four pins to be programmed (SCK, MISO, MOSI, RESET). There pins can be removed after the debugging. 
          <img src="images/details18.jpg">
          
          <br>
          So far, I tested the board and it seems there are no electrical issues and the clock is working properly (I used a simple blink and a watch to do a very basic test).
          <img src="images/details24.jpg">
          
          <br>
          <h3>Debug and V0.2</h3>
      <p>
      after the first test i noticed the following problems:
      <ul>
      <li>Return of current from the motors power supply</li>
          <li>Add (and then take away) pull-up resistors</li>
          <li>Mistakes in pin mapping, because of the way the Grbl is written</li>
          <li>Wrong stepper drivers wiring</li>
          <li>TX\RX connection flipped</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
      
      <strong>Return of current from the motor power supply</strong>
      <br>
      <p>
      the board had two different circuits with a common GND, one at 12V for the motor and one at 5V from the FTDI cable. I tried to power the board with the FTDI and to upload the blink to check clock and the main circuit and everything worked fine. After that I tried to power the motod circuit at 12V. I had no shortcircuit but, because of something I don't know, from the 12V circuit an instable current (approximately from 1.8V to 2.7V), passed to the 5V circuit.  
          
      /* immagine con tester */
      
      I tried to cut some traces without finding the problem, so it's still a mistery.
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>Add (and then take away) pull-up resistors</strong>
      <br>
      The endstops have no pull-ups resistors (too complex to wire everything on the board), thinking to use the internal ones in the ATMEGA328p. After I tested (unsucessfully) the board, I thought to avoid any problem by adding external resistors.
      \*foto resistenze volanti*\
      checking better the Grbl I actually noticed that the resistors are activated by default so i decided to desolder the external i added and I'm not going to try to modify the board for that.
      
      
      <br><br>
       <strong>Mistake in pin mapping, because of the way the Grbl is written</strong>
      <br>
       I will use a modified version of Grbl, both because of the documentation you can find about it, and because i can fit it in the ATMEGA 328P. Reading the code I noticed that some pins cant be remapped: the information about step and dir of the motors are writtend not pin by pin but writing the Port and the DDR, so it's important to don't change over a certain limit. Here the wrong modification I was doing
      /*immagine con mapping */
      This wasn't enough but it's definitely something to integrate on the next one.
      <br>I noticed that inverting two connections the mapping could be done properly, so I modified the board for the testing
      /* immagine con i cavetti volanti */
      
      
      <br><br>
      <strong>Wrong stepper drivers wiring</strong>
      I followed the wiring of original board, but the stepper driver I'm using (the <a href="http://www.pololu.com/product/2133">DRV8825</a>), has a compatible but not exactly identical wiring. Here the original drivers used on the shapeoko board
      <br>
          <img src="https://a.pololu-files.com/picture/0J3360.600.png?d94ef1356fab28463db67ff0619afadf">
          While the one I used are
      <img src="https://a.pololu-files.com/picture/0J4232.600.png?f2f6269e0a80c41f0a5147915106aa55">
          
          The main mistake was actually another one: I wired microstepping and emable to 5V, while to enable the board it should be grounded.
      
      
      
      
       </p>
          <strong>Next steps</strong>
         
          <p>
          <ul>
      <li>test drivers + motors with a temporary code (Processing + Firmata)</li>
              <li>Test the grbl on this board, after have properly mapped the pins of the ATMEGA 328p </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <br>
                <h3>Y movement</h3>
	<p>
	The most tricky part is probably how to move the machine along Y. I started following <a href="http://www.bg-cnc.com/wordpress/?p=542" target="_blank"> this</a> solution:
  <img src="http://www.bg-cnc.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/realistic-x-sect.jpg" alt="components" height="600" width="900">
        <img src="http://www.bg-cnc.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/New-Belt-Drive-Side.jpg" alt="components" height="600" width="900">
        
        <br>
        This allow me to dismount the machine without too many problems. <br>
    The first solution to test is to use a circular belt moved by a stepper that use a secont linear belt glued to the rail as a rack. 
	</p>

        A - Circular belt <br>
        B - Pulley <br>
        C - Y motor <br>
        D - Linear belt (rack) <br>   
          </strong>  
    <br>

	<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Download "Detail_Y.svg"</button>
	</a>
    <br><br>
      The solution I made so far is wrong dimensionally but the idea could work
          
          <img src="images/structure62.jpg">
          
          It works like a caterpillar track that moves over another timing belt used as a rack. 
          <img src="images/structure71.jpg">
          
          To guarantee the proper pressure and avoid backlash, the structure is preloaded with springs
          <img src="images/structure72.jpg">

             <h3>Z movement</h3>
    <p>
    To move in Z the entire machine is sliding down. This seems to me the most rigid way to move the structure instead of have a Z axis made as usual. The objective was to keep the force loop as short as possible.
    
    <br>
    Here two Z position compared (first high and then low)
    <img src="images/pos1.JPG" width="900">
    <br>
    
    The movimentation is done with two motors and two threaded bars. To avoid the backlash I designed two 3D printed parts preloaded with a spring and aligned with four screws
    <img src="images/structure69.jpg">
    </p>
        
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
       There is still a long run to do. This is going to be my check list:
        
        <lu>
        <li>Check all the connections and assembling holes</li>
            <li>Decide the assembling process and testing it</li>
            <li>decide the endstop position and regulation</li>
            <li>implement the fixing and assembly a more definitive version</li>
            <li>test together electronic and mechanic</li>
        </lu>
        </p>
