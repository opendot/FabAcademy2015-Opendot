     <h2>05. 3D Scanning and Printing</h2>
    
        
   <h3>Project</h3>
	<p>
	My objective for this exercise is to make a piece of a bike frame with the lost wax process.
        <br> Design a bike frame is not easy at all, in particular to do it with the proper angles. I did a little bit of practive for the project <a href="http://www.rootless.tk">Rootless</a>. In the tutorial section there are some extra info on how to make it.
    <br> An alternative to design it form scratch is to "copy" an existing one. 
        <br> In the first part i'm gonna scan a bike frame to get a quick and rought result. After that I'm designing and printing a connection for that.
	</p>
        
          <h3>3D scanning</h3>
	<p>
	My objective for this exercise is to make a piece of a bike frame with the lost wax process.
        <br>
        To do that i need a 3D scan to use a reference, for diameters and angles. Probably there are easier ways with such a simple geometry, but I wanted to test the process to eventually apply it in other (more complex) situations.
        <br>
        Together with <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/ciurnelli.mattia/index.html">Mattia Ciurnelli</a> we used a Kinect to scan the bike. to keep a regular distance from the object we used a nylon thread.
        <br>
        <img src="images/2900-1.jpg" alt="Tools"  width="900">  
        <br>
        Here the process:
        <br>
        first step we choose the reference point, the center of a virtual sphere around the object
        <img src="images/3720-1.jpg" alt="Process1"  width="900">  
         <br>
        Then we mesured the distance form that point to the kinect to have a good result. The software helps you a lot showing in green the parts at the right distance
        <img src="images/2943-1.jpg" alt="Process2"  width="900">
         <br>
        While the software is recording I moved the kinect around, staying focused minly on the front part, cause i didn't need a high detail back part too. 
        <img src="images/3437-1.jpg" alt="Process1"  width="900">
        <img src="images/3444-1.jpg" alt="Process1"  width="900">
    <br>
        The software we used is <a href="http://skanect.occipital.com/">Skanect</a>. It's pretty simple and quick. We started evaluating the distance
        <img src="images/162951.jpg" alt="Process1"  width="900">
        After it has recorded the scan, it's creating a 3D model and it's showing the path done with the kinect
        <img src="images/163622.jpg" alt="path1"  width="900">
        <img src="images/163638.jpg" alt="path2"  width="900">
    In the end it's creating a 3D model that can be shown with or without texture. 
        <img src="images/163722.jpg" alt="without texture"  width="900">
        <img src="images/163901.jpg" alt="with texture"  width="900">
        </p>
        
<h3>3D modeling</h3>
	<p>
	Being just a reference, i imported the stl as is in rhino
         <img src="images/sc1.jpg" alt="stl"  width="900">
       I used that Stl to extract a geometric approximation that will become the base of my design
         <img src="images/sc2.jpg" alt="geometry"  width="900">
        As you can notice, it's still noisy and it's not as precised as i hoped. Beside that, I went on with my project and i created this net that wires the joint. This should help the soldering and resist to torsion. The design is based on some topological optimization found online.
        <img src="images/sc3.jpg" alt="design"  width="900">
        <img src="images/sc4.jpg" alt="design"  width="900">
        It was to complex to do it in grasshopper+millipede, but that was the original idea.  At the end I got a lot of pipes basically impossible to merge together. 
         <img src="images/rhino1.jpg" alt="pipes"  width="900">
        Rhinoceros still has some troubles with the boolean union, and it's pretty common to be unable to merge complex geometry. To do so, I used "Solidify" in Meshmixer (123D app). It's a simple shortcut to merge together meshes into a single oblect perfectly closed. The last step was blender to smooth the connection between the pipes. This is how it looks at the beginning
        <img src="images/blender1.JPG" alt="original"  width="900">
        And here after a "subsurface" (modifier -> subsurface)
        <img src="images/blender2.JPG" alt="sub"  width="900">
The final Stl file is approximately 110Mb, so i have to upload a lighter vesion before being fused in a single piece (with meshmixer) and being smoothed (with blender)<br><br>

 </p>
        <h3>3D printing</h3>
	<p>
	To print such a complex shape in a material suitable for the lost wax process I used the DWS 020X, a high resolution SLA 3D printer
         <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/71/eb/95/71eb9561bc86b346c4d663f84ce4e697.jpg"  height="600">
From the machine software it's easy to set support material, resolution and resin's characteristics. I used a "digital wax" designed for jewelery and dental purpose. 
        <img src="images/P1180114.jpg" alt="software"  width="900">
While the machine is printing you can see the laser spot
        <img src="images/P1180110.jpg" alt="laserspot"  width="900">
        After the piece is finished there is a period of curing in a UV oven
        <img src="images/P1180115.jpg" alt="UV"  width="900">
        Here the final object
        <img src="images/5102-1.jpg" alt="final"  width="900">     
        And here two details: in the first picture you can notice that when the surfaces are almost flat, even if the layers are very thin they become visible. The second shows how a small detachment of a fragment create a "shadow cone effect", the laser is polymerizing the resin attached to the fragment and not to the object.
        <img src="images/P1180119.jpg" alt="final"  width="900"> 
        <img src="images/P1180120.jpg" alt="final"  width="900">
