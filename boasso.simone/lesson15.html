    <h1>Applications and Implications</h1>
       </br></br>
      <h8>This week lecture is to answer some question about our final project</h8>
    </br></br>


<h7>Question 1:</h7>
<h4>What will it do?</h4>

<h8>The main features that my project is intended to do is open the draw where the item you searching for is placed. This will help when you have a lot of item in a drawers and you not use it frequently, or is used by many different people that don't have enough time to learn where the item are placed or will waste a lot of time reading all the name on the draws.</br>
A lot of software features can be added like remote control from a smartphone or a item finish alert and so on.
</h8>
</br></br>
</br></br>
<h7>Question 2:</h7>
<h4>Who's done what beforehand?</h4>

<h8>this project take inspiration from the big robotic storage used in the industry, like Amazon, aliexpress and so on.</br>
They receive the order from the web, and then the order is processed only by robot who read the barcode and prepare the box for the shipping.</br>
    I see on-line someone try to make this smaller but mine will be made at low cost price for the maximum usability and to be easy to make.</h8>

</br></br>
</br></br>

    <h7>Question 3:</h7>
<h4>What materials and components will be required?</h4>

<h8>For make it low cost I will use common material that can be find in local hardware shop or cheap online store:</br></br>

    Structural materials: wood frame (mdf is more cheap than plywood), or acrylic ( a little bit more expensive),bearing (replecable by 3d printed), 3d printed structure, belt, pulley, aluminium rod.</br></br>
	
    Electronics equipment: an Arduino like board (atmega328p), stepper driver, endstop, stepper motor, actuators </br></br>
	
    Firmware: a sort of grbl used for cnc machine that can provide xy coordinates control</br></br>
	
	software: a database of item</br></br>

    this is more or less the components and material i need.</h8>

</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 4:</h7>
<h4>Where will they come from?</h4>

    <h8>electronic is produces in the OpenDot fablab, components and motor are from china,the wood and other stuff like rod and so on are from a local harware shop.</br> 3d printed part are from my printer and pla or abs are from the company i work for here in Milan Filoalfa.</h8>


</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 5:</h7>
<h4>How much will it cost?</h4>

<h8>I concentrate to make is low cost and scalable.</br>
    this make the 2 different type of cost: the fixed ones is the electronic part ( don't change whit the dimension of the drawers stage, made of motor electronic board, driver and actuators), that is around 80€ I think ( worst case), but i try to keep it lower; an then the frame and movement system that can be escalated for the need,( in my case i make a small prototype only for testing so it will be less) that can be from 10 to 30€.</h8>

</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 6:</h7>
<h4>What parts and systems will be made?</h4>

<h8>i will made the following things:</br></br>

	-frame</br>
	-moving system</br>
	-actuator part</br>
	-electronic board</br>
	-stepper driver</br>
	-drive belt</br>
	-software for research item and communicate whit electronics</br>
    </h8>

</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 7:</h7>
<h4>What processes will be used?</h4>

    <h8>I think I have a lot of process involved</br></br>
    laser engraving pcbs</br>
    soldering and testing pcbs</br>
    laser cutting the frame (or maybe for more large building using the cnc milling machine)</br>
    3D printing mechanics and support for the moving part</br>
    embedded electronic programming</br>
    software programming and developing</h8>


</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 8:</h7>
<h4>What tasks need to be completed?</h4>

<h8>for now i have a lot of experience in this king of building and a nice background of moving system,
    but in this project for now i need to do all the things.</h8>


</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 9:</h7>
<h4>What questions need to be answered?</h4>

    <h8>how build it low cost and what task implement.</h8>



</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 10:</h7>
<h4>What is the schedule?</h4>

    <h8>i'm a little busy whit my sister marriage in this period( she will marry on 24/05/2015) so i will update this section as soon i get back my time to spend on this project</h8>


</br></br>
</br></br>
    <h7>Question 11:</h7>
<h4>How will it be evaluated?</h4>

<h8>the evaluation will be made by the user experience from the people who will try it in the lab,
    the most simple task where be open a draw after a research of the object.</h8>
